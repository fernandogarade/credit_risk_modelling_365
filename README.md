# Credit Risk Modelling repository
This repository was created when doing the 365 Careers Credit Risk Modelling Course.
Link to the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-risk-modeling-in-python/

You can find here the notebooks developed during the course and an extra last notebook where a new data input is processed through the models and the final expected loss prediction is built.

Datasets are not uploaded here for 2 reasons: it's size and 365 Careers' ownership.
